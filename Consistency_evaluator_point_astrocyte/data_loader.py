    Detects duplicate keys during JSON parsing and counts occurrences of each key.

    This function intercepts the key-value pairs provided by `json.loads` and ensures that
    duplicate keys are flagged. It constructs the dictionary normally but counts how often
    each key appears, recording any keys that occur more than once.

    Args:
        pairs (list of tuple): A list of key-value pairs at the current level of the JSON.
        duplicate_keys_state (dict): The dictionary to update with any duplicates found.
